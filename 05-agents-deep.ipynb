He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: महात्मा, meaning great-souled/venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.\n",
      "Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London and was called to the bar in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land-tax.\n",
      "Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.\n",
      "Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948, when Gandhi was 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. \n",
      "Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India. During India's nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after, he was also commonly called Bapu, an endearment roughly meaning \"father\".\u001b[0m\n",

      "\n",
      "**Question 1: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?**\n",
      "\n",
      "* This is handled correctly.  The follow-up questions effectively determine the answer.\n",

      "\n",
      "* This example highlights a significant problem. The intermediate answer attempts to extract the answer from a large block of text that is largely irrelevant and contains many unrelated sentences.  The system fails to accurately extract the relevant information.  The final answer is correct *only if* the extracted information is accurate, which it is not guaranteed to be given the method used.  The system should have used a more reliable source (like a simple database or Wikipedia lookup) to answer this question.  The warning about needing a reliable source is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Issues:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest problem is the reliance on potentially unreliable text extraction for answering factual questions.  While the chain of reasoning is sound in the correctly answered questions, the system's ability to accurately extract information from arbitrary text is unreliable and prone to errors.  This is a common limitation of large language models.  For factual questions, a more robust approach would be to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use structured knowledge bases:**  Instead of relying on text parsing, use a database or knowledge graph that contains verified facts.\n",
      "2. **Employ fact-checking mechanisms:**  Even with structured data, incorporate mechanisms to verify the information from multiple sources.\n",
      "3. **Improve text parsing:** If text parsing is necessary, use more sophisticated techniques that can better handle complex sentences and irrelevant information.  This might involve techniques like named entity recognition and relationship extraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The current system demonstrates a brittle approach to question answering that works well only when the input text is simple and directly relevant.  It needs significant improvements in its information retrieval and processing capabilities to be reliable for a wider range of questions.\n",

      "1. **Structured Knowledge Bases:**  Using databases or knowledge graphs is the most reliable approach for factual question answering.  These sources provide structured, verified information, eliminating the need for unreliable text parsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fact-Checking Mechanisms:**  Even with structured data, incorporating fact-checking is essential.  This could involve cross-referencing information from multiple reputable sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Improved Text Parsing (if necessary):** If text parsing is unavoidable, advanced techniques like named entity recognition (NER), relationship extraction, and coreference resolution are needed to improve the accuracy and robustness of information extraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Source Selection:**  The system needs a mechanism to select reliable sources.  This could involve a pre-defined list of trusted websites or a ranking system based on authority and trustworthiness.\n",
      "* **Error Handling:**  The system should gracefully handle cases where it cannot find an answer or where the information is uncertain.  Instead of providing a potentially incorrect answer, it should indicate that it doesn't have enough information to answer the question confidently.\n",
      "* **Contextual Understanding:**  For more complex questions, the system needs better contextual understanding to correctly interpret the question's intent and identify the relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, the current system needs a fundamental redesign to incorporate structured knowledge, fact-checking, and more robust information processing techniques to become a reliable factual question-answering system.  Relying solely on large language models for factual retrieval is inherently risky due to their susceptibility to hallucinations and biases.\n",

      "* **Explicit Error Handling:**  The system should gracefully handle cases where it cannot find an answer or where the information is uncertain.  Instead of providing a potentially incorrect answer, it should clearly indicate that it lacks sufficient information to answer confidently.\n",
      "* **Contextual Understanding and Question Decomposition:** For complex questions, the system needs improved contextual understanding to correctly interpret the question's intent and, if necessary, decompose it into smaller, more manageable sub-questions.\n",
      "* **Confidence Scores:**  Assigning confidence scores to answers would allow users to assess the reliability of the information provided.  A low confidence score would indicate uncertainty and the need for further verification.\n",
